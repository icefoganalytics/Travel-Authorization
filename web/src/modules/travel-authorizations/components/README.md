# Travel Authorizations Components

Component names should follow Vue convention where possible.
If the component deals with multiple items it should be pluralized.
If it deals with a single item, it should be singularized.
If the component name is specific to the active user, it should have My in the component name.
If the component is role/action specific, it should start with that role/action.
e.g. EditMyTravelAuthorizationDetails
Folder names should match the names of the parent components they belong to.
