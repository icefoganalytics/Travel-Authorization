# Travel Authorization Pages

Pages are components that can be routed to directly.
Component names should end in `Page`.
Page specific components should be in the components/name-of-page-component directory.

e.g.
- `web/src/modules/travel-authorizations/pages/MyTravelAuthorizationsEditDetailsPage.vue`
has specific components in `web/src/modules/travel-authorizations/components/my-travel-authorizations-edit-details-page`
